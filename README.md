WIP xQuery 3.1 g4 lexer and grammar files

This is my very green attempt to construct antlr4 Lexer and Parser files for [xQuery 3.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/).


# Tests

I use a simple Makefile to generate build and test.


``` 
# to build
make
# to test
make test
```

When developing these g4 files, I have tried to use the examples provided 
in the [xQuery 3.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/) recommendation.
These examples are in the fixtures directory.
Each test name is derived from the substring id found in the xQuery recomendation document URL
e.g. `https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/#doc-xquery31-VersionDecl`
should  be fixture test name `VersionDecl`


## Developing

I use these test fixtures when I am working on the g4 files.  e.g.

```
make
make show-tokens TEST=VersionDecl
make show-gui TEST=VersionDecl

```

The above example will build, 
then show the tokens produced by the lexer  using the VersionDecl fixture,
then show the AST tree  produced by the parser
